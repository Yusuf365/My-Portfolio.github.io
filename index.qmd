Hello, my name is Mohammed Yusuf Shaikh, and I am an ambitious undergraduate currently pursuing an Honors Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Toronto, with a double major in Economics and Applied Statistics. My academic background has provided me with a strong analytical foundation, and I am particularly interested in pursuing careers in finance and data analytics. 

I am eagerly seeking opportunities to apply my theoretical knowledge in practical, real-world settings. Beyond academics, I am also actively pursuing the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation, showcasing my dedication to continuous learning and professional development in the field of finance.

Delve into my latest projects, where I apply my unique blend of skills and perspectives to create innovative solutions. From web applications that streamline processes to software tools that solve complex problems, each project reflects my commitment to pushing boundaries and making a tangible impact.
